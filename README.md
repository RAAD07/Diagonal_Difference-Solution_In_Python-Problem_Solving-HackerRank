# Diagonal_Difference-Solution_In_Python-Problem_Solving-HackerRank

Problem:

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix  is shown below:

1 2 3

4 5 6

9 8 9 

The left-to-right diagonal =1+5+9=15. The right to left diagonal 3+5+7=17. Their absolute difference is |15-17=2.

Function description:
Complete the diagonalDifference function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the absolute diagonal difference.  diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:  arr: an array of integers .

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer,n; the number of rows and columns in the matrix arr .
Each of the next n lines describes a row, arr[i] , and consists of n space-separated integers arr[i][j].

Output Format:
Print the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

Sample Input:

3

11 2 4 

4 5 6 

10 8 -12 

Sample Output: 15
